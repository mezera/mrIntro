% Purpose: 
%
% The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the underlying visualization 
% methods used in the analysis of MR data. The tutorial includes examples of 
% tissue segmentation into gray matter and white matter, the definition of the 
% surface boundary of the brain as a mesh, and related anatomical measurements, 
% such as volume and surface area.
%

%% Load a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI dataset of someone's head:
load mrTutVisualizationData.mat
% Let's see what got loaded:
whos
% anat contains the image data. We'll examine the brain mask and mesh later. The 
% other array (voxDim) tells us the size of physical space (in millimeters) that
% each image voxel represents:
voxDim

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 1: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% a. What is the field of view of this image?
% b. What is the volume of one voxel?
%

%% Examine a slice from this dataset

% The T1-weighted MR data are stored in a 3d array called 'anat'. Here's
% one slice from the middle of this array:
figure(1); set(gcf,'name','Middle slice');
imagesc(anat(:,:,90));

% We'll format the image to make it look nicer:
axis equal tight;
colormap gray;
colorbar;

% In this T1-weighted image, tissues with long T1 values show up as dark
% (cerebro-spinal fluid, CSF), medium T1 values are gray (gray matter, GM,
% and muscle), and shorter T1 values are white (white matter, WM,
% subcutaneous fat in the scalp). In addition to T1-weighting, this image
% includes some proton density weighting. That's why bone and air, which
% have relatively little free water, also show up as dark. Because this
% image is not based on a quantitative MR method, the image intensity
% values are in arbitrary units, so only the realtive intensities (image
% contrast) are important.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 2: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Try to identify the different tissue types in the image.
% a. cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF)
% b. White matter (WM)
% c. Gray matter (GM)
% d. bone
% e. muscle
% f. scalp
% g. air
%

% Now let's add some labels so that you can see how well you did:
figure(1)
text(86,124,['\color{green}CSF']);
text(158,134,['\color{green}WM']);
text(120,60,['\color{green}GM']);
text(117,173,['\color{green}bone']);
text(140,24,['\color{green}muscle']);
text(87,181,['\color{green}scalp']);
text(15,20,['\color{green}air']);

%% Working in three dimensions
%
% Remember that this is a 3d dataset. Let's look at all the slices as a
% simple movie.
figure(2);
for(thisSlice=[1:size(anat,3)])
    imagesc(anat(:,:,thisSlice));
    axis equal tight;
    colormap gray;
    pause(0.05);
end
%%
% We can also show the middle slice of each axis
figure(3);
middleSlices = round(size(anat)/2)
subplot(1,3,1);
imagesc(anat(:,:,middleSlices(1)));
axis equal tight; colormap gray;
subplot(1,3,2);
imagesc(squeeze(anat(:,middleSlices(2),:)));
axis equal tight; colormap gray; 
subplot(1,3,3);
imagesc(squeeze(anat(middleSlices(3),:,:)));
axis equal tight; colormap gray;


%% Segment the brain tissue
% 
% The first step to segmenting the interesting brain tissues is to remove
% the annoying scalp and skull. This is often called "brain extraction." It
% can be done manually, by carfully labeling each voxel. There are also
% some very good algorithms that can do this task automatically. We've
% applied one of these tools (FSL BET: http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/bet2/)
% and saved the resulting brain mask. 
%
% Here is the brain mask for the same middle slice that we saw above. This
% 'mask' is a simple image with 1's indicating brain tissue and 0's
% indicating non-brian tissue.
figure(4); set(gcf,'name','Brain mask for middle slice');
imagesc(brainMask(:,:,90));
axis equal tight; colormap gray; colorbar;
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 3: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% What is the volume of the brain in cubic centimeters?
% Hint: the volume of one voxel in cubic mm is prod(voxDim).
%
%%
% Now apply the brain mask by setting all non-brain voxels to 0:
brain = double(anat);
brain(~brainMask) = 0;
figure(5); set(gcf,'name','Brain only');
imagesc(brain(:,:,90));
axis equal tight; colormap gray; colorbar;

% Let's look at a histogram of the image intensities in the brain.
figure(6); set(gcf,'name','Image intensities in the brain');
hist(brain(:), 100);
xlabel('Raw intensity'); ylabel('Pixel count');
% There are many voxels with an intensity of zero, including all the stuff
% outside the brain that we set to zero above. Let's rescale the axes to
% make
% the more interesting features evident:
axis([0 32765 0 8e4]);
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 4: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% a. How many peaks are there in this histogram?
% b. What tissue types do these peaks represent?
%
%%
% Here's a line that is likely to divide white and gray matter intensities
wmThreshold = 24500;
figure(6)
line([wmThreshold wmThreshold], [0 8e4], 'color', 'r');
text(wmThreshold, 7.5e4, 'white matter threshold', 'color','r', 'HorizontalAlignment', 'center');

%% Segment out the white matter based on this boundary
whiteMatter = brain > wmThreshold;
% Clean up the segmentation with a little smoothing. For a real
% segmentation, we would also want to have a human expert edit the
% segmentation to ensure that it is correct.
whiteMatter = smooth3(double(whiteMatter))>0.5;

% Inspect the segmentation
brainScaled = brain/max(brain(:));  % rescale intensities to be between 0 and 1
brainWmRgb = cat(4,brainScaled*.5+whiteMatter*.5,brainScaled,brainScaled);
figure(7); set(gcf,'name','White matter segmentation');
for(thisSlice=[1:size(brainWmRgb,3)])
    image(squeeze(brainWmRgb(:,:,thisSlice,:)));
    axis equal tight;
    pause(0.1);
end

% ***** Question 5: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% What is the volume of the white matter in cubic centimeters?
%


%% View the brain surface.
% The arachnoid is one of the three membranes that cover the brain (meninges). 
% By fitting a surface to the brain mask, we get something that represents the 
% arachnoid surface.
arachSmooth = smooth3(brainMask);
figure(8);
set(gcf, 'renderer', 'OpenGL');
% The following command might take a little while to complete.
p = patch( isosurface(arachSmooth) );
isonormals(arachSmooth, p);
set(p, 'FaceColor', [.5 .45 .46], 'EdgeColor','none');
daspect([1 1 1]);
view(3), axis vis3d tight off, camproj perspective, camlight, lighting phong
set(gcf,'Color','w');
rotate3d;

% Show the triangles that make up this mesh. (You'll probably need to zoom
% in to see them.)
set(p,'edgeColor','k');


%% Measure the white matter surface.
% We've used the isosurface function to fit a set of triangles to the white 
% matter mask and saved them in the 'mesh' structure. This surface represents
% the boundary between cortical gray matter and white matter.
mesh

% The triangles that make up this surface are represented as a list of
% vertices (points in 3d space) and a list of the triangles (faces). Each
% face is comprised oflll integers that are indices into the vertex list.
% For example, here are the three coordinates of the first triangle:
mesh.vertices(mesh.faces(1,:),:)
% These vertex coordinates are specified in the voxel coordinate space. To
% convert to physical space (ie. millimeters), we need to scale by the
% voxel dimentsions: 
verticesMm(:,1) = mesh.vertices(:,1)*voxDim(1);
verticesMm(:,2) = mesh.vertices(:,2)*voxDim(2);
verticesMm(:,3) = mesh.vertices(:,3)*voxDim(3);

% Now that the vertices are in real physical space, we can compute the area
% of the triangles using Heron's formula. First we compute the length of each
% of the three edges that comprise each triangle using the Euclidian distance 
% formula. We find the length of the first edge in the first triangle by 
% computing the distance between the two vertices that form that edge:  
v1 = verticesMm(mesh.faces(1,1),:)
v2 = verticesMm(mesh.faces(1,2),:)
firstEdgeDistance = sqrt( sum( (v1 - v2).^2 ) )

% We can compute all the edge lengths very quickly with this dense bit of
% code. The resulting arrays contain all three edge lengths for all the
% triangles, with the first edge in a, the second in b, and the third in c.
a = sqrt(sum((verticesMm(mesh.faces(:,1),:) - verticesMm(mesh.faces(:,2),:)).^2, 2));
b = sqrt(sum((verticesMm(mesh.faces(:,2),:) - verticesMm(mesh.faces(:,3),:)).^2, 2));
c = sqrt(sum((verticesMm(mesh.faces(:,3),:) - verticesMm(mesh.faces(:,1),:)).^2, 2));
% Let's check that we got the same answer as when we just did just one edge:
a(1)
firstEdgeDistance

% Now find the half the perimeter of each triangle:
s = (a+b+c)/2;
% And finally, apply Heron's formula:
faceArea = sqrt(s.*(s-a).*(s-b).*(s-c));
% The total surface area, in mm^2 is:
sum(faceArea)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 6: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% a. What is the surface area of this person's white matter, in square centimeters?
% b. How many 8.5 x 11 inch sheets of paper would it take to cover this white matter surface?
%    (Hint: One inch equals 2.54 centimeters.)
% c. Assuming the cortex is 3mm thick, estimate the volume of the cortical gray matter and
%    compare this to the white matter volume.
%
    
%% Visualize the 3d white matter surface. 
% First, we center the vertices on 0,0,0 so that all rotations are about
% the center of mass: 
mesh.vertices(:,1) = mesh.vertices(:,1)-mean(mesh.vertices(:,1));
mesh.vertices(:,2) = mesh.vertices(:,2)-mean(mesh.vertices(:,2));
mesh.vertices(:,3) = mesh.vertices(:,3)-mean(mesh.vertices(:,3));
% Now make the figure:
figure(9);
set(gcf, 'renderer', 'OpenGL');
imagesc(0);
p = patch('vertices', mesh.vertices, 'faces', mesh.faces, ...
          'facecolor', 'interp',...
          'FaceVertexCData', mesh.curvature, ...
          'VertexNormals', mesh.vertexNormals, ...
          'edgecolor', 'none');
colormap(copper);      
daspect([1 1 1]);
view(3), axis vis3d tight off, camproj perspective
set(gcf,'Color','w');
rotate3d;

pialVertices = mesh.vertices;
for iter=1:4
    pialVertices = pialVertices+mesh.vertexNormals;
end
%%
figure(10);
set(gcf, 'renderer', 'OpenGL');
imagesc(0);
p = patch('vertices', pialVertices, 'faces', mesh.faces, ...
          'facecolor', 'interp',...
          'FaceVertexCData', mesh.curvature, ...
          'VertexNormals', mesh.vertexNormals, ...
          'edgecolor', 'none');
colormap(copper);      
daspect([1 1 1]);
view(3), axis vis3d tight off, camproj perspective
set(gcf,'Color','w');
rotate3d;
