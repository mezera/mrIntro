% Purpose: 
%
% The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the nature of the data
% acquired in a diffusion tensor imaging scan.  The new statistical issues
% involved in analyzing these data, and the computational methods that are
% available for interpreting these data, are also introduced.


%% Self-diffusion of water
%
% The self-diffusion coefficient of water (in micrometers^2/millisecond) is
% dependent on the temperature and pressure. Several groups have derived
% quantitative descriptions of the relationship between temperature,
% pressure, and the diffusion coefficient of water. Here we use the formula
% presented in:
%   Krynicki, Green & Sawyer (1978) Pressure and temperature dependence of 
%   self-diffusion in water. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc., 66, 199 - 208.
% Also see http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/explan5.html and Mills (1973)
% Self-Diffusion in Normal and Heavy Water. JPhysChem 77(5), pg. 685 - 688.

% Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level, in kilo Pascals (kPa):
P = 101.325;

% Let's define a function that implements the Krynicki formula. This will
% return the self-diffusion of water (in micrometers^2/millisec) given the
% temperature T (in Centigrade) and the pressure P (in kPa).
selfDiffusionOfWater = @(T,P) 12.5 .* exp(P*-5.22*10^-6) .* sqrt(T+273.15) .* exp(-925.*exp(P.*-2.6.*10^-6)./(T+273.15-(95+P.*2.61.*10^-4)));

% The self-diffusion of water at body temperature and standard pressure is:
selfDiffusionOfWater(37,P)

% Let's plot D for a biologically meaningful range of temperatures
T = [25:40];
D = selfDiffusionOfWater(T,P);
figure(1);
plot(T, D, 'k');
xlabel('Temperature (Centigrade)');

% ***** Question 1: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% a. The average atmospheric pressure in Denver Colorado is about 84 kPa. 
%    What is the difference (in percent) between the self-diffusion
%    coefficient of water at body temperature in Denver compared to 
%    Palo Alto, which is about at sea level?
% b. Suppose you are running a fever of 40 deg Centigrade. Compared to 
%    someone without a fever, how much higher (in percent) is the water 
%    diffusion coefficient in your body?

%% Brownian motion
%
% Here we simulated the brownian motion in a small chunk of tissue.
% The size of the simulated voxel, in micrometers:
voxelSize = 50.0;
% Define the time-step (in milliseconds):
timeStep = 0.02;
% The number of time-steps:
nTimeSteps = 100;
% The ADC (in micrometers^2/millisecond)
ADC = 2.0;
% The number of particles to simulate:
numParticles = 500;
% Should we add the barriers? If so, set the barrier spacing here. Set this
% to 0 for no barriers.
barrierSpacing = 10;
totalTime = 0;

% Now initialize the figure:
axLims = [-voxelSize/2 voxelSize/2];
figure(2); clf;
xlabel('X position (micrometers)');
ylabel('Y position (micrometers)');
axis square;
axis([axLims axLims]);
set(gca,'ALimMode','manual','XTick',[axLims(1):10:axLims(end)],'YTick',[axLims(1):10:axLims(end)]);
%%
% Place some particles randomly distributed in the volume
% (Note: to sample a circle uniformly, we need to take sqrt(r) to get more
% points at the larger radii.)
r = sqrt(rand(numParticles,1))*voxelSize/2;
[x,y] = pol2cart(rand(numParticles,1)*2*pi, r);
startPos = [x,y];
curPos = startPos;
hold on;
for(p=1:numParticles)
	ph(p) = plot(curPos(p,1), curPos(p,2), '.','markerSize',12);
end
if(barrierSpacing>0)
    curCompartment = floor(curPos(:,2)/barrierSpacing);
    compartments = unique(curCompartment);
    for(ii=1:numel(compartments))
        line(axLims,[compartments(ii)*barrierSpacing compartments(ii)*barrierSpacing],'color',[.7 .7 .8]);
    end
    cmap = hsv(numel(compartments));
    for(p=1:numParticles)
        set(ph(p), 'color', cmap(curCompartment(p)==compartments,:));
    end
end
hold off;
grid on;
ah = gca;

%% Run the diffusion simulation
%
for(ti=1:nTimeSteps)
    % Update all the particle positions given the ADC. The diffusion
    % equation tells us that the final position of a particle moving in
    % Brownian motion can be described by a Gaussian distribution
    % with a standard deviation of sqrt(ADC*timeStep). The following lines
    % will update the current particle position by drawing numbers from a
    % Gaussian with this standard deviation.
    d = randn(numParticles,2)*sqrt(2*ADC*timeStep);
    newPos = curPos+d;
    if(barrierSpacing>0)
        curCompartment = floor(curPos(:,2)/barrierSpacing);
        newCompartment = floor(newPos(:,2)/barrierSpacing);
        reflectTheseParticles = newCompartment~=curCompartment;
        % A simple hack to approximate particles reflecting off the impermeable barrier
        newPos(reflectTheseParticles,2) = curPos(reflectTheseParticles,2) - d(reflectTheseParticles,2);
    end
    curPos = newPos;
    % Draw the particles in their new positions:
    for(p=1:numParticles)
        set(ph(p), 'XData', curPos(p,1), 'YData', curPos(p,2));
    end
    % To avoid biasing our ADC estimates with edge effects, we allow
    % particles to move outside of our simulated voxel.
    set(get(ah,'Title'),'String',sprintf('elapsed time: %5.1f ms',timeStep*ti));
    % Pause is specified in seconds, so the following will play the movie
    % about 1000 times slower than reality.
    pause(timeStep-.01);
    totalTime = totalTime + timeStep;
end
%%
% Show where each particle came from:
hold on;
for(p=1:numParticles)
	sh(p) = plot([startPos(p,1) curPos(p,1)], [startPos(p,2) curPos(p,2)], '-', 'color', [.9 .9 .9]);
end
hold off;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 2: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% a. What is the average position change (startPos-curPos) of each particle?
% b. What is the average distance that each particle moved? (Hint: compute
%    the Euclidean distance that each moved.)
%

% By comparing the particle ending positions (in curPos) with their
% starting positions (in startPos), we can compute the diffusion tensor.
% This is essentially just a 2-d Gaussian fit to the position differences,
% computied using Matlab's covariance function (cov). We also need to
% normalize the positions by the total time that we diffused.
Dt = cov(startPos-curPos,1)./(2*totalTime)
% The eigensystem of the diffusion tensor describes an isoprobability
% ellipse through the data points. 
[vec,val] = eig(Dt);
estimatedADC = diag(val)'
principalDiffusionDirection = vec(2,:)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ***** Question 3: ***** %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% a. Run the simulation with and without barriers by adjusting the
%    'barrierSpacing' variable. How does the diffusion tensor change?
% b. Adjust the barrier spaceing. What effect does this have on the
%    princpal diffusion direction? On the estimatedADC values?
% c. With barriers in place, reduce the number of time steps (nTimeSteps).
%    How does this affect the estimatedADC values? Explore the interaction
%    between the barrier spacing and the number of time steps.
