% This tutorial has a lot of reading at the front
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%  This tutorial introduces the student to the basic methods of linear
%  systems theory, focusing on the tools of shift-invariant linear systems.
%  The tutorial introduces the idea of superposition,  shift-invariance,
%  and impulse response functions. These ideas are fundamental to many
%  methods and analyses used in functional neuroimaging and through
%  engineering and science.
%
%  Linear systems theory is a method of characterizing certain types of
%  common systems.  A system is something that has an input and an output,
%  and thus we can think of it as a function output = L(input).
%
%  For example, the system might be an optical element, like a lens, that
%  takes an image as an input and produces another image as an output. Or,
%  this system may be a biological system that we are measuring, for
%  instance the BOLD response that is the consequence of neural activity.
%
%  Characterizing the complete input-output properties of a system by 
%  exhaustive  measurement is usually impossible. When a system qualifies
%  as a linear system, it is possible to use the responses to a small set
%  of inputs to predict the response to any possible input. This can save
%  the scientist enormous amounts of work, and makes it possible to
%  characterize the system completely.
%
%  Not all systems can be described using linear systems theory. To use
%  linear methods to describe a system, it must satisfy the basic principle
%  of superposition.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  The principle of superposition
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  The principle of superposition in words is simply this:
%
%  If the response to input A is Ra, and the response to input B is
%  Rb, then the response to the sum of A and B (A+B) is the sum of the
%  responses: Ra + Rb.
%
%  In equation form this is
%
%            If L(A) = Ra and L(B) = Rb, then L(A + B) = Ra + Rb
%
%  There is one simple consequence of superposition that is often taken as
%  a special case and named the principle of homogeneity.  
%  Suppose that the inputs are equal, namely, A = B. 
%  It is easy to see that L(A + A) = Ra + Ra and thus L(2A) = 2Ra. 
%  In general, if s is any scalar, a linear system will satisfy the rule:
%
%           if L(A) = Ra, then L(sA) = sRa
%
%  An enormous number of simple systems satisfy superposition over a fairly
%  large range of inputs.  Linear systems theory is a basic tool used
%  throughout engineering, physics, and statistical modeling.  
% 
%  In this tutorial, we will build up some of the tools of linear systems
%  theory.  These include the use of matrices to describe a linear system,
%  the very important special case of a shift-invariant linear system, and
%  the associated ideas of the impulse response function
%
%  All of these ideas are used in functional neuroimaging.  In fact, nearly
%  every field that uses linear systems theory develops its own terminology
%  (jargon) to describe the general ideas of linear systems theory in the
%  specific context of that field.   
%
%  In neuroimaging, the hemodynamic response function (HRF) is the impulse
%  response function. The analysis of the modulations in block-design
%  experiments are closely connected to the system transfer function.
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Impulses and shift-invariance
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% All time varying stimuli can be thought of as a series of impulses at
% different levels. We can approximate any complex stimulus as if it were
% simply the sum of a number of shifted and scaled impulses. 
%
% A shift-invariant linear system is a special case when the system
% responds in the same way to every impulse, no matter when the impulse
% occurs in time.  That is, it doesn't matter what happened just before the
% impulse or what happens just after the impulse.  The response to the
% impulse will be the same.
%
% The only difference in the response to different impulses is that the
% responses are shifted in time to correspond to the impulse and multiplied
% by a scalar that equals the size of the impulse.  
%
% The significance of the principle of superposition is this:
%
% If we know the impulse response function, we can predict the response to
% any stimulus (combinations of impulses).  We compute the response to each
% impulse and then add up all the results.
%
% Practically, to characterize shift-invariant linear systems, then we need
% to measure only one thing: the way the system responds to an impulse of a
% particular intensity. This response is called the impulse response
% function of the system. 
%
% The analysis of BOLD data presupposes that the responses are
% shift-invariant linear systems.  In this field, the impulse response
% function is called the hemodynamic response function, or HRF.
%
% In neuroimaging, the principles of  superposition and shift invariance
% are essential to the ideas used in rapid event-related designs: The
% underlying assumption is that if you have two neural (or cognitive)
% events A and B occurring one after the other, then the BOLD response of A
% and the BOLD response of B  will be identical (but B will be shifted in
% time with respect to A) and thus total BOLD signal after these two events
% is a sum of two independent responses shifted in time:
%
% BOLD (A+B)=BOLD(A) + BOLD(B).
%

% Now, we do some simple calculations

%% Read and plot the SPM Hemodynamic response function (HRF)

RT = 1;         % Repetition time - sample every second
[hrf,p] = spm_hrf(RT); 

nT = p(7);   %Number of time steps
t  = 0:nT;   %Individual time samples of the HRF

figure(1), clf
plot(t,hrf)
xlabel('Time (sec)')
ylabel('HRF level')
grid on

% Notice that the hrf values sum to 1.
%
% This means that convolution with the HRF will preserve the mean of the
% input stimulus level.
sum(hrf)

% Also, notice that the default SPM HRF has a post-stimulus undershoot

%% Make a pair of stimuli
% 1st event at time 1
time1=1; stim1=zeros(1,nT); stim1(time1)=1;

% 2nd event at time 2
time2=8; stim2=zeros(1,nT); stim2(time2)=1;

%% Plot the stimulus and output of a linear system with the SPM HRF
figure(1), clf
subplot(2,2,1); plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold; 
plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]); hold
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5])
title('Stimulus 1')

bold1=conv(stim1,hrf);
subplot(2,2,2); plot(t(1:nT),bold1(1:nT))
axis([0 30 -0.5 .8]);
title('Stimulus 1 BOLD response')

% second stimulus and output
subplot(2,2,3);  plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold;
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); hold
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5])
title('Stimulus 2 - shifted in time')
xlabel('time[s]')

bold2=conv(stim2,hrf);
subplot(2,2,4); plot(t(1:nT),bold2(1:nT));   
axis([0 30 -0.5 .8]);
set(gcf, 'color', [ 1 1 1])
title('Stimulus 2 BOLD response');
xlabel('time[s]')

%% Event-related design

% Suppose a subject sees stimulus 1 and then and then later stimulus 2. The
% total stimulation is therefore:
stim3 = stim1 + stim2;

% According to the principle of superposition the output should be the sum
% of the individual events. Thus, the output can be  written as the sum of
% the outputs of stimuli 1 and 2
%
figure(3)
subplot(2,2,1); plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold; 
plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]);
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); 
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5]);
hold
title('Stimulus 1 + Stimulus 2')

% Calculating the output using the superposition principle
BOLD3 = bold1(1:nT) + bold2(1:nT);

subplot(2,2,2); plot(t(1:nT),BOLD3);
axis([0 30 -0.5 .8]);
xlabel ('time [s]')
ylabel('% signal change')
title('Output - according to the superposition principle')
set(gcf,'color',[ 1 1 1])

% Convolution is a mathematical function that applies the
% superposition principle:
% basically it sums over all impulse responses shifted in time
%
% output=sum(hrf*input(t))
%
%
subplot(2,2,3); plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold; 
title('Stimulus 3')

plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); 
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5]);
hold

% We can use the matlab conv function to calculate the 
% output using the convolution operator:
% for the rest of the tutorial, we will use the conv command
%
bold3=conv(stim3,hrf);

subplot(2,2,4); plot(t(1:nT),bold3(1:nT))
axis([0 30 -0.5 .8])

%% Block design experiments
%
% We will start with blocks of 2 events and then continue to longer blocks.
% We will examine how the number of events and the spacing between events
% affects the predicted bold signal.
%

%% Example 1: Two events that are spaced 4 seconds apart
figure(4), clf

% 1st event at time 1
time1 = 1; stim1=zeros(1,nT); stim1(time1)=1;

% 1st event at time2
time2 = 5; stim2=zeros(1,nT); stim2(time2)=1;

stim4 = stim1 + stim2;

% stimulus
subplot(4,2,1); plot((1:22),zeros(1,22)); hold; 
plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); 
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5]);
hold
title('Stimulus')

% BOLD
bold1=conv(stim4,hrf);
subplot(4,2,2); plot(t(1:nT),bold1(1:nT));axis([0 30 -0.5 .8])
axis([0 30 -0.5 0.8]);
ylabel('% signal change')
title(' BOLD response')

%% Example 2: Two events that are spaced 2 seconds apart
% Note that here you get one peak and not 2 peaks
% Why? 
time1=1;
time2=3;

stim1=zeros(1,nT);
stim1(time1)=1;    % 1st event at time 1
stim2=zeros(1,nT);
stim2(time2)=1;     % 2nd event at time 2

stim5=stim1+stim2;

subplot(4,2,3); plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold; 
plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); hold
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5]);

bold1 = conv(stim5,hrf);
subplot(4,2,4); plot(t(1:nT),bold1(1:nT));axis([0 30 -0.5 .8])
ylabel('% signal change')

%% Example 3:  3 events that are spaced  2s apart

time1=1;time2=3;time3=5;
stim1=zeros(1,nT); stim2=zeros(1,nT); stim3=zeros(1,nT); 
stim1(time1)=1; % 1st event at time 1
stim2(time2)=1; % 2nd event at time 2
stim3(time3)=1;  % 3rd event at time 3

stim=stim1+stim2+stim3;

subplot(4,2,5); 
plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold; 
plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time3 time3 time3], [0 .5 1]); 
axis([0 30 -0.5 1.5]);

bold1 = conv(stim,hrf);
subplot(4,2,6);
plot(t(1:nT),bold1(1:nT));
axis([0 30 -0.5 0.8]);
xlabel('time [s]');
ylabel('percent signal change');
set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]);

%% Example 4: 5 stimuli given 2 seconds -> block which is 10 seconds long

%  What changed as you increased the number of stimuli?
%  Why?

time1=1;time2=3;time3=5;time4=7;time5=9;
time_stim = 1:2:9;
stim = zeros(1,nT);
stim(time_stim)=ones(size(time_stim));

subplot(4,2,7); plot((1:nT),zeros(1,nT)); hold; 
plot([ time1 time1 time1], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time2 time2 time2], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time3 time3 time3], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time4 time4 time4], [0 .5 1]); 
plot([ time5 time5 time5], [0 .5 1]);

%% Thought Questions 

% 
% ***** QUESTION 1 ***** 
% Researchers presented stimuli in 2 blocks. In the first block they
% presented flashing checkboards at a rate of 1Hz for 10 seconds. In the
% second block they presented flashing checkerboards at a rate of 1hz for
% 20 seconds. How will the amplitude and/or duration of the block-response
% change between conditions? Explain.
%
% ***** QUESTION 2 ***** 
% Researchers presented stimuli in 2 conditions. In the first condition
% they presented a tone for 1 second, waited for 8 seconds, and presented a
% second tone for 1 second. In the second condition, they presented a tone
% for 1 second, waited 1 second, and presented a second tone for 1 second.
% How will the response differ in amplitude and/or duration between the two
% conditions? A plot/graph will be useful in explaining the answer.
